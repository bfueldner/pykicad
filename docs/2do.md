# Symbole

* If reference == #PWR, render symbol as power symbol automatically
* Detect PinName visible automatic (if all names set to ~, nothing is visible)
* Change inner text to vertical, if there is no space?
* Handle min symbol width or margin?
* Fix pin decoration
* Remove document field (already set in dcm-files)
* Symbol constructor with name and reference field instead of later adding these fields
* Enable CSV loading for subunits (should work easily)
