Symbole
o If reference == #PWR, render symbol as power symbol automatically
o Detect PinName visible automatic (if all names set to ~, nothing is visible)
o Change inner text to vertical, if there is no space?
o Handle min symbol width or margin?
o Fix pin decoration
o Remove document field (already set in dcm-files)
o Symbol constructor with name and reference field instead of later adding these fields
o Enable CSV loading for subunits (should work easily)
